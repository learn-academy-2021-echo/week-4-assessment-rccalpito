# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in react are "properties" that are passed from a parent component to a child component. These props can pass both data and behavior to a child component. These passed properties are only one directional, and cannot be passed from child to parent. In order to pass said behavior or data to a component, the function/state variable must be passed using this.props.

  Researched answer: Props are used to pass data from parent to child components in react and are the main mechanism for component communication. These props are what allow react component patterns to work.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: The DOM is a document object manager. This is the display that is refreshed and updated that a user sees. A DOM event is an event that happens on the screen that causes a re-rendering of what is being displayed.

  Researched answer: DOM events are a signal that something has ocurred, or is ocurring and can be triggered by browser interactions. DOM events include user clicks, web pages loading, image loading, mouse hovers, input changes, form submissions and user key strokes.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is the methodology that the programs be thought of as data driven (objects), instead of behavior driven (functions). 

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming is the concept of objects which can contain data and code. In OOP, programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP are class based. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: An integer is a whole number value. A float is a decimal value that can be represented up to a certain number of bits. 

  Researched answer:Floats are used when precision is required in numbers. Floating type values have potential decimal places up to 32 bits wide. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return is such that functions do not to return explicit values. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return is when the return function isn't explicitly called, and the prgram returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: In OOP instance variables are defined for a specific class. Each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy or instance. These variables are not static.

2. PostgreSQL: AKA postgres is a database management system that emphasizes extensibility and SQL compliance. 

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is to ruby, as react is to javascript. Ruby on Rails is a framework to create ruby programs. It removes the unecessary, and often repetative elements to creating a program, and does it for you. 

4. ORM: Object relational mapper is a programming technique for converting between incompatible system tylpes in OOP languages. 

5. Active Record: The layer of a system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active records facilitate the creation and use of business objects.
